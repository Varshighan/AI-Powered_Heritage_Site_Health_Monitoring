-# üöß Automated Crack Detection and Depth Estimation

## üìñ Description

This project presents an **automated defect detection system** focused on crack detection and depth estimation using a combination of computer vision techniques and deep learning models.

Traditional inspection methods for infrastructure are often slow, labor-intensive, and error-prone. While some existing solutions address issues like spalling and discoloration, they typically ignore vegetation interference or lack segmentation capabilities.

This solution uses **YOLO-based segmentation** models and **Canny edge detection** to enhance crack localization. By integrating this into a **real-time interface using Streamlit or OpenCV**, the system enables early crack detection, reducing inspection time and improving maintenance efficiency. When connected with live CCTV or drone footage, the system enables faster, more accurate corrective actions.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time crack detection via webcam
- Crack segmentation using YOLOv8
- Edge localization using Canny Edge Detection
- Depth estimation (for severity indication)
- Web app interface (Streamlit) and local OpenCV UI
- Lightweight and scalable
